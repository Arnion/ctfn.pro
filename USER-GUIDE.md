## Importing certificate in Cryptowallet


Importing the NFT certificate into the TrustWallet is automatic.

To import the certificate into a Metamask wallet, the student needs to know the **NFT token address** and **ID**. Then switch to the network (BNB Mainnet or BNB Testnet) in Metamask and click **Import NFT** in the NFT tab.
