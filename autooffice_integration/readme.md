# Integration with existing systems

To test the functionality of the service, we developed an integration with the LMS platform AutoOffice and held a training webinar for students of one of the educational organizations.

## Integration with the LMS AutoOffice platform.
Users were able to request their certificates from their personal accounts.	
The administration of the online school was able to mint certificates using the smart contract from CTFN.PRO on the BNB Smart Chain Mainnet. 
JavaScript library was used to connect CTFN.

## Educaniowebinar 
Webinar was held for students of the Arnion Online School, teaching them how to create a Metamask wallet and import their NFT-certificates.
50 users requested a total of 64 certificates (some users received certificates for multiple courses).
